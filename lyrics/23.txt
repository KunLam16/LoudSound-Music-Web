There I was again tonight<br>
Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
Same old tired, lonely place<br>
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy<br>
Vanished when I saw your face<br>
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you<br>
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"<br>
'Cross the room your silhouette<br>
Starts to make its way to me<br>
The playful conversation starts<br>
Counter all your quick remarks<br>
Like passing notes in secrecy<br>
And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you<br>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
The lingering question kept me up<br>
2 AM, who do you love?<br>
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br>
And now I'm pacing back and forth<br>
Wishing you were at my door<br>
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"<br>
It was enchanting to meet you<br>
All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you<br>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
This is me praying that<br>
This was the very first page<br>
Not where the story line ends<br>
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again<br>
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
