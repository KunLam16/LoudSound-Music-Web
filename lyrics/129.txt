He said, "Let's get out of this town<br>
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"<br>
I thought Heaven can't help me now<br>
Nothing lasts forever<br>
But this is gonna take me down<br>
He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
He's so bad, but he does it so well<br>
I can see the end as it begins<br>
My one condition is<br>
Say you'll remember me<br>
Standing in a nice dress<br>
Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
Say you'll see me again<br>
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
I said, "No one has to know what we do"<br>
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room<br>
And his voice is a familiar sound<br>
Nothing lasts forever<br>
But this is getting good now<br>
He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
He's so bad, but he does it so well<br>
And when we've had our very last kiss<br>
My last request is<br>
Say you'll remember me<br>
Standing in a nice dress<br>
Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
Say you'll see me again<br>
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)<br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
You'll see me in hindsight<br>
Tangled up with you all night<br>
Burning it down<br>
Someday when you leave me<br>
I bet these memories<br>
Follow you around<br>
You'll see me in hindsight<br>
Tangled up with you all night<br>
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)<br>
Someday when you leave me<br>
I bet these memories<br>
Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around)<br>
Say you'll remember me<br>
Standing in a nice dress<br>
Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
Say you'll see me again<br>
Even if it's just pretend<br>
Say you'll remember me<br>
Standing in a nice dress<br>
Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
Say you'll see me again<br>
Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah)<br>
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha<br>
