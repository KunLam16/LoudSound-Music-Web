We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January<br>
And this is our place, we make the rules<br>
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear<br>
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?<br>
Can I go where you go?<br>
Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
And ah, take me out, and take me home<br>
You're my, my, my, my<br>
Lover<br>
We could let our friends crash in the living room<br>
This is our place, we make the call<br>
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you<br>
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all<br>
Can I go where you go?<br>
Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
You're my, my, my, my<br>
Lover<br>
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?<br>
With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover<br>
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover<br>
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me<br>
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover<br>
Can I go where you go?<br>
Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
You're my, my, my, my<br>
Oh, you're my, my, my, my<br>
Darling, you're my, my, my, myv
Lover<br>
