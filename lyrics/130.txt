My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in<br>
Everyone looked worse in the light<br>
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven<br>
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye<br>
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you<br>
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you<br>
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night<br>
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight<br>
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky<br>
And so I became the butt of the joke<br>
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked<br>
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke<br>
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down<br>
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town<br>
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now<br>
It's brighter now, now<br>
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you<br>
(I can never look away)<br>
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you<br>
(Things will never be the same)<br>
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night<br>
(Now I'm wide awake)<br>
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
And I can still see it all (In my mind)<br>
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)<br>
I once believed love would be (Black and white)<br>
But it's golden (Golden)<br>
And I can still see it all (In my head)<br>
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)<br>
I once believed love would be (Burning red)<br>
But it's golden<br>
Like daylight, like daylight<br>
Like daylight, daylight<br>
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you<br>
(I can never look away)<br>
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you<br>
(Things will never be the same)<br>
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night<br>
(Now I'm wide awake)<br>
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
Like daylight<br>
It's golden like daylight<br>
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go<br>
Just let it go, let it go<br>
I wanna be defined by the things that I love<br>
Not the things I hate<br>
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of<br>
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night<br>
I, I just think that<br>
You are what you love<br>
