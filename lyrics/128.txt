I don't like your little games<br>
Don't like your tilted stage<br>
The role you made me play of the fool<br>
No, I don't like you<br>
I don't like your perfect crime<br>
How you laugh when you lie<br>
You said the gun was mine<br>
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)<br>
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br>
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined<br>
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me...<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
I (I) don't (don't) like your kingdom keys (keys)<br>
They (they) once belonged to me (me)<br>
You (you) asked me for a place to sleep<br>
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)<br>
The world moves on, another day another drama, drama<br>
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma<br>
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure<br>
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours<br>
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)<br>
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)<br>
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined<br>
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me...<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br>
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br>
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br>
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br>
I'm sorry<br>
But the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now<br>
Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead (oh)<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me...<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me...<br>
Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
Look what you just made me do<br>
