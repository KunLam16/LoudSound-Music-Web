Don't try to make yourself remember, darling<br>
Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told<br>
So let's pretend a little longer<br>
'Cause when we're gone<br>
Everything goes on<br>
Well, you were staring at the window<br>
And I said, "I wanna take you to the sea"<br>
And when I'm better, we'll do everything<br>
I gotta stop making promises I can't keep<br>
But if I was gone tomorrow, won't the waves crash on?<br>
Is it selfish that I'm happy as we pass the setting sun?<br>
Someday I'll be overcast, but you won't have to cry<br>
'Cause we'll do the grieving while I'm by your side<br>
I said<br>
Don't try to make yourself remember, darling<br>
Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told<br>
So let's pretend a little longer<br>
'Cause when we're gone<br>
Everything goes on<br>
And I'm so scared of getting used to this<br>
All the vines that keep you tethered in your room<br>
Someday both of us are leaving here<br>
But for now, I'll just bring to the sea to you, ooh<br>
When you meet me in the daylight like we did before<br>
Then I felt you on my shoulder, and you weren't suffering anymore<br>
You said, "I'm sorry that you worry, but don't apologize"<br>
I told you to forget me, but you stayed by my side<br>
When I said<br>
Don't try to make yourself remember, darling<br>
Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told<br>
So let's pretend a little longer<br>
And when we're gone, ah<br>
Everything goes on<br>
