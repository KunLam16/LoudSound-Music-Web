I love you and me<br>
Dancing in the moonlight<br>
Nobody can see<br>
It's just you and me tonight<br>
<br>
You know I gotcha<br>
You know that I got you like that<br>
Ain't nobody gon' have your back<br>
Like the way I do<br>
You love it just say you do<br>
You know you got me<br>
Everything you do<br>
Everything you did<br>
Everything I wish I was with<br>
Makes me feel alright<br>
I'm just saying, so<br>
I really like it<br>
Nothing in the world can make me feel<br>
The way you do, the things you do<br>
I really like it<br>
Nothing in the world can make me feel<br>
The way you do, the things you do<br>
I love you and me<br>
Dancing in the moonlight<br>
Nobody can see<br>
It's just you and me tonight<br>
I love you and me<br>
Dancing in the moonlight<br>
Nobody can see<br>
It's just you and me tonight<br>
Look at you, now look at me<br>
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?<br>
Look at you, now look at me<br>
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?<br>
You're the reason my heart skips drops<br>
Just a little touch my world stops<br>
Finally I know that you're mine<br>
I don't want to fall<br>
Don't wanna play this game of love, oh-eh-oh<br>
There's nowhere to hide<br>
I really like it<br>
Nothing in the world can make me feel<br>
The way you do, the things you do<br>
I really like it<br>
Nothing in the world can make me feel<br>
The way you do, the things you do<br>
I love you and me<br>
Dancing in the moonlight<br>
Nobody can see<br>
It's just you and me tonight<br>
I love you and me<br>
Dancing in the moonlight<br>
Nobody can see<br>
It's just you and me tonight<br>
Look at you, now look at me<br>
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?<br>
Look at you, now look at me<br>
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?<br>
(Ever, ever gonna find someone like this)<br>
(Someone like this)<br>
I don't care about your first love<br>
This should be your last one<br>
Nothin' like your last one<br>
You look better on me, that's fashion<br>
Won't block your shot, lights, camera, action<br>
Never been a love me or a love me not thing<br>
Every petal better tell him, better not change<br>
I love you, I love me a lot, wait<br>
Which one I love better? Better off not saying<br>
I love you and me<br>
