Rain, he wanted it comfortable<br>
I wanted that pain<br>
He wanted a bride<br>
I was making my own name<br>
Chasing that fame<br>
He stayed the same<br>
All of me changed like midnight<br>
My town was a wasteland<br>
Full of cages, full of fences<br>
Pageant queens and big pretenders<br>
But for some, it was paradise<br>
My boy was a montage<br>
A slow-motion, love potion<br>
Jumping off things in the ocean<br>
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice<br>
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain<br>
He wanted it comfortable<br>
I wanted that pain<br>
He wanted a bride<br>
I was making my own name<br>
Chasing that fame<br>
He stayed the same<br>
All of me changed like midnight<br>
It came like a postcard<br>
Picture perfect, shiny family<br>
Holiday, peppermint candy<br>
But for him it's every day<br>
So I peered through a window<br>
A deep portal, time travel<br>
All the love we unravel<br>
And the life I gave away<br>
'Cause he was sunshine<br>
I was midnight rain<br>
He wanted it comfortable<br>
I wanted that pain<br>
He wanted a bride<br>
I was making my own name<br>
Chasing that fame<br>
He stayed the same<br>
All of me changed<br>
Like midnight<br>
Rain, he wanted it comfortable<br>
I wanted that pain<br>
He wanted a bride<br>
I was making my own name<br>
Chasing that fame<br>
He stayed the same<br>
All of me changed<br>
Like midnight<br>
I guess sometimes we all get<br>
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted<br>
And he never thinks of me<br>
Except when I'm on TV<br>
I guess sometimes we all get<br>
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted<br>
And I never think of him<br>
Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)<br>
