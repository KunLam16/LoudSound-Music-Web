Once you left I went to space<br>

I don’t recognize this place<br>

Where are you<br>

Where are you<br>

<br>

Now I miss the smallest things<br>

I’m not ready for this change<br>

<br>

Where are you<br>

Where are you<br>

Can’t help but wonder<br>

Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now<br>

Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about<br>

I heard you’re moving on and now<br>

You got it figured out<br>

Well i’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you<br>

<br>

Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now<br>

Hey, ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without<br>

Each other, now you got another got it figured out<br>

Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you<br>

Happy for you<br>

Just wanna be happy too<br>

<br>

Một trái tim nhớ thương đợi chờ<br>

Chờ giấc mơ bên em trở về<br>

Em nơi nào<br>

Em nơi nào<br>

Dù chúng ta đã không còn gì<br>

Hồi ức xưa nay vẫn còn đây<br>

Em nơi nào<br>

Em nơi nào<br>

Vấn vương toàn niềm đau<br>

Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now<br>

Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about<br>

I heard you’re moving on and now<br>

You got it figured out<br>

Well i’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you<br>

<br>

Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now<br>

Hey, ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without<br>

Each other, now you got another got it figured out<br>

Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you Happy for you<br>

<br>

Just wanna be happy too<br>

Lukas: I’ve lived with all this<br>

Long enough, long enough<br>

Don’t you still wonder<br>

If it could’ve been us<br>

Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now<br>

Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about I heard you’re moving on and now<br>

You got it figured out<br>

<br>

I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you<br>

Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now<br>

Hey, ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without<br>

Each other, now you got another got it figured out<br>

Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you<br>

Happy for you<br>
